# Music-classification
Music classification by genre.

This is a music classification inspired by these articles : https://medium.com/@sukantkhurana/music-classification-using-artificial-intelligence-3d21c59c5cb2 and https://medium.com/@matanlachmish/music-genre-classification-470aaac9833d.
I also followed some of the basic steps of this article : https://towardsdatascience.com/music-genre-classification-with-python-c714d032f0d8.
